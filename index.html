					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						I have over 20 years of development experience on various systems and languages. Over that time, I've reinvented myself, 
						not satisfied to continue only with what I am familiar and proficient at but striving to grow and add to my skill set. 
						Although my passion is in solving problems replacing inefficient manual processes with stream lined automation, 
						I have also developed into a strong and respected leader who can manage a team and make difficult decisions. 
						I believe that if you write software as if you are going to be the one that has to use it, you produce a higher quality easy to use product.
